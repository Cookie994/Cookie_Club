E-commerce website that I made in order to practice PHP :)<br>
It is fully functional - you can register, log in and out, pick out a product and add it to your shopping cart (or add multiple, remove items), search for a specific item,
order by prices or name, etc. I've created an admin panel aswell and added authentication and authorization (not everyone can see everything), addressed security concerns with validation and sanitation of input and prepared statements, encrypted passwords; made it possible to be able to see profiles and edit them.<br>
This project of mine is outdated in a sense that it could be improved in a lot of ways - it's written in procedural style instead of object-oriented making it harder to read and change, it has a lot of redundant code and in a lot scripts I've repeated big blocks of code which is unnecessary. I could've used PDO for security, made classes to handle CRUD easier and so on.. I can see a lot of things that needs changing and adding to it (front-end for a beginning), but I kept it the way it is - it was, after all, my first big venture into programming.<br>
<b>Technologies used</b> - PHP, SQL, a little bit of JavaScript (AJAX, JSON) and MySQL relational database<br>
